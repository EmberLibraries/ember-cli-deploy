For Ember CLI >= 0.2.3,

```
ember install ember-cli-mirage
```

For Ember CLI < 0.2.3,

```
ember install:addon ember-cli-mirage
```

## Bower

If something seems wrong after you've installed Mirage, try running

```
ember generate ember-cli-mirage
```

This ensures all of Mirage's Bower dependencies are added to your project. It's supposed to run during `ember install`, but this functionality is broken in some versions of Ember CLI.
