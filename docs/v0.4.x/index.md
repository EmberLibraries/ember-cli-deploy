title: Overview

This project includes the necessary commands for 'Lightning Fast Deployments of
Ember-CLI Apps'. The whole workflow is heavily inspired by Luke Melia's talk
about [Lightning Fast Deployment(s) of Rails-backed Javascript Apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZVYP3cPcWQ).

In addition to the "Lightening Fast Deployment" approach, Ember CLI Deploy supports other types of deployment strategies. View the section on [custom adapters](./custom-adapters-overview) to learn more.

The following video by [Ben Limmer](https://github.com/blimmer) at [Ember.js-Denver](http://www.meetup.com/Ember-js-Denver/) gives a good overview of the project:
