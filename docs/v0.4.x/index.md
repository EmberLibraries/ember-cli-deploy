title: Overview

This project includes the necessary commands for 'Lightning Fast Deployments of
Ember-CLI Apps'. The whole workflow is heavily inspired by Luke Melia's talk
about [Lightning Fast Deployment(s) of Rails-backed Javascript Apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZVYP3cPcWQ).

`ember-cli-deploy` aims to be the go-to-solution for deploying all Ember-CLI apps thus it also supports other types of deployments that differ from the one Luke suggests. Please see this README's subsection about [custom adapters](#custom-adapters) on how to get started with your own deployment strategy with `ember-cli-deploy`.

You can also have a look on how to use this ember-cli addon in the following video of a talk about `ember-cli-deploy` [Ben Limmer](https://github.com/blimmer) gave at [Ember.js-Denver](http://www.meetup.com/Ember-js-Denver/).
