---

This is an example of how one would use this addon to deploy an ember-cli app:

* `ember deploy --environment production`
* `ember deploy:list --environment production` (this will print out a list of revisions)
* `ember deploy:activate --revision <your-app-name>:44f2f92 --environment production `
