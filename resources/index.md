# Getting help

## Slack

The [Ember Community Slack](https://embercommunity.slack.com/) is the best place to get in touch. [Click here](https://ember-community-slackin.herokuapp.com/) if you need to sign up.

Once inside Slack, visit the *#ember-cli-deploy* channel. A core team member or other community member should be around to help you out.

## Github

Our main Github repository is [ember-cli/ember-cli-deploy](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli-deploy). Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli-deploy/issues/new) if you find a bug or have a technical question.

We have a separate [ember-cli-deploy Github org](https://github.com/ember-cli-deploy) for ember-cli-deploy plugins maintained by the core team.
